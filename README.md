# Pricing Data Collection from E-Commerce Stores

During the webinar on “Driving E-Commerce Success Through Pricing Data: Are You Getting It Right?”, our Engineering Manager, Povilas Kudriavcevas, showcased how to collect product pricing data from https://books.toscrape.com, using Oxylabs [<u>Web Crawler</u>](https://oxylabs.io/features/web-crawler) and [<u>Web Scraper API</u>](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web). In this repository, you will find the Apache Airflow DAGs he used during the webinar. 

## Apache Airflow setup
Follow official documentation `https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/index.html`

## Setup
1. Copy the contents of the `dags` folder into your Apache Airflow project.
2. Configure your Oxylabs credentials in the `settings.py` file.
3. Specify the absolute path to the `database.db` file located in the `dags` folder.
4. Execute the DAGs using the Apache Airflow UI.
